"""3D viewport: orbital camera, grid, XYZ axes, tools, snapping and overlays.

Uses PySide6's bundled QOpenGL* helper classes (QOpenGLShaderProgram,
QOpenGLBuffer, QOpenGLVertexArrayObject) — no external GL bindings yet.
moderngl lands when we start dealing with real meshes.

Wayland requires every frame to be drawn explicitly: ``paintGL`` always
calls ``glClear`` first to avoid showing stale GPU memory.

Navigation:
- Middle-button drag: orbit
- Shift + Middle-button drag: pan
- Wheel: zoom
- P: toggle perspective / parallel projection

Axis lock (active while drawing):
- Right arrow: toggle lock to X (red)
- Left arrow:  toggle lock to Y (green)
- Up arrow:    toggle lock to Z (blue)
- Down arrow:  toggle parallel / perpendicular lock to the edge under cursor
- Shift held:  contextual lock — locks whatever inference is active at the
               moment (auto-axis or reference). Hold to lock, release to free.

While drawing, the rubber band also auto-aligns to axes within ~3° (soft
inference, visual cue only). Press Shift while the rubber band turns an
axis colour to lock that direction.

Tool input (when a tool is active):
- Left click: ``tool.on_click(ToolContext)``
- Mouse move: ``tool.on_hover(ToolContext)``
- Esc:        ``tool.on_cancel(viewport)``
- Other keys: tool gets first shot via ``tool.on_key(...)``

    on the Plaza Yanque model, so ten guides would have cost 200 ms a
    frame. The depth buffer already knows the answer for free.

    A guide is a HALF-MILLION-METRE line (``GUIDE_HALF_LEN``), so it is not
    dashed end to end: the run is centred on the guide's closest point to
    ``centre`` (the camera target) and reaches ``reach`` metres each way,

    ``_axes_vertices``, so the on-screen density stays put across zoom and
    the dashes converge toward the horizon in perspective. Dashing the
    whole length instead, under any sane cap, gave 27-metre dashes with
    22-metre gaps: at a 16-metre view the guide fell in a gap and vanished.

    Returns ``(coords, spans)``: a flat float array and
    ``[(first_vertex, count, selected)]``, one entry per guide LINE, so the
    caller can colour the selected ones without a second buffer. Guide
    points are not here — they stay screen-space crosses in the overlay.
