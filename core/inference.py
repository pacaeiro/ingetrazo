"""The viewport's snapping inference, in one place.

``Viewport`` had grown a small state machine -- the edge and centre under the
cursor, the reference edge/corner acquired while drawing, the encouraged
points the cursor paused on, the axis and reference locks, the snap search
itself -- threaded through a dozen private attributes and half a dozen
methods. Keeping it beside the widget made every one of those methods read as
part of the drawing surface.

This collaborator owns that state and its rules. The viewport still hands it
the cursor (``_process_hover`` reads the picks through :meth:`acquire`, and
``_build_ctx`` / ``_refresh_snap`` ask :meth:`snap`) and renders what it
decides (``_snap_scene``, ``_draw_overlay``), but the "which point is the
reference, what is encouraged, which axis is locked" bookkeeping lives here.
The dialogue is one-way -- the engine reaches back to the viewport for the
picks, the projections and a repaint, never the other way -- and the viewport
exposes thin delegating properties so the rest of the class, tools,
extensions, the probe and the tests keep reading ``vp._acquired_point``,
``vp.axis_lock`` and friends unchanged.

The two post-processors that used to run on the viewport at the end of
the search -- the axis-source cue (the Tape hovering a model axis) and
the extension hooks -- now run at the end of :meth:`snap`, so what the
viewport draws is what the engine decided, with no second pass.
