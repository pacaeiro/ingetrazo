"""Snap engine: pick the best snap target near the cursor.

Snap kinds (priority high → low):
1. ``"axis"``           — explicit axis lock from arrow keys.
2. ``"reference"``      — parallel/perpendicular lock to a reference edge.
3. ``"axis"`` via Shift — Shift held while an axis inference is active.
4. ``"close"``          — closing the current polygon chain.
5. ``"endpoint"``       — vertex of an existing edge.
6. ``"intersection"``   — where two edges / guide lines actually cross (green X).
7. ``"midpoint"``       — midpoint of an existing edge.
8. ``"origin"``         — world origin.
9. ``"on_edge"``        — arbitrary point along an edge (start a shape on it).
10. ``"aligned"``       — level with / in line with an encouraged point across
                          the face under the cursor (the axis plane through it).
11. ``"axis_inference"`` — soft auto-detected axis alignment (visual cue only).
12. ``"none"``          — no snap.

Distance checks for point snaps are done in **screen-space pixels** so the
snap radius stays constant under zoom. The caller supplies a
``world_to_pixel`` callback so this module does not depend on Qt's
viewport directly.

    #     It used to live ABOVE the named points and only before the first

    #     afternoon. Measured with a clean 4 m line and one end acquired,
    #     the cursor sitting exactly on its midpoint:
    #
    #         nothing acquired      midpoint     0.00 cm
    #         one end acquired      from_point   0.65 cm
    #
    #     An alignment LINE was beating a named POINT, so clicking the
    #     midpoint of a wall quietly landed centimetres off and the drawing
    #     came out skewed — reported twice before it was caught («del medio
    #     de la línea quiero dibujar una línea, dibujo sale desfasada»; «sí
    #     agarra, solo cuando termina el dibujo está desfasado»). His own
    #     case was 2.8 cm on a 4 m wall.
    #
    #     Down here it sits below endpoint, midpoint, intersection and
    #     origin, and above the soft axis cue — and it no longer cares
    #     whether an operation is under way, which is the other half: the
    #     reference used to die at the first click, exactly when he needed
    #     it to hold a rectangle's length to a corner.
    #
    #     Marco, 2026-09-18, drawing a step along a wall: «en la segunda
    #     esquina está la referencia pero al momento de jalar el rectángulo
    #     se pierde la referencia». Measured with the wall's far corner
    #     acquired and the cursor pulled out to give the step its depth:
    #
    #         before the first click   from_point   x = 6.430   (the corner)
    #         rectangle under way      none         x = 6.370   (drifted)
    #
    #     The machinery was built and working; it was locked away at exactly
    #     the moment he needed it. Push/pull modellers offer it mid-operation too.
    #
    #     It is a SECOND call rather than an unlocked condition on 5d,
    #     because 5d sits above the named points: opening it in place would
    #     have let an alignment line outrank a midpoint or the origin, and
    #     that precedence is not ours to spend. Down here it competes only
    #     with the soft axis cue below — the weakest rule there is.
